# Keras & Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for various purposes such as web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. It is known for its simplicity, readability, and ease of use, making it an ideal language for beginners and experts alike. Python's syntax is designed to be concise and intuitive, with a focus on readability, allowing developers to write code that is easy to understand and maintain. Python's versatility is further enhanced by its extensive range of libraries and frameworks, including NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn for data science, Flask and Django for web development, and TensorFlow and Keras for machine learning. With its vast community and extensive resources, Python has become a popular choice for developers and data scientists, and is often used in conjunction with other languages to create powerful and efficient solutions.
